# WORKING WITH COMMON EVENTS
This section deals with three simple projects : 
 __1.__ A list of images is displayed on the page. As we click on the images they get eliminated unless one image is left. When we click on the final image information about this image is displayed.
__2.__ When an image is hovered over a larger version of the image is previewed.
__3.__ When we right click on the image a preview of the larger version appears and the preview follows the mouse.
